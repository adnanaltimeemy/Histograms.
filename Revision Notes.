Sure! Here's a **short and simple revision note on Histograms**:

### ðŸ“Š **Histogram â€“ Revision Note**

* A **histogram** is a type of bar graph used to represent **continuous grouped data**.
* It shows **frequency** through the **area** of bars, **not height alone**.
* Bars are **joined together** (no gaps) because the data is continuous.
* The **x-axis** represents **class intervals** (e.g., 0â€“10, 10â€“20).
* The **y-axis** shows **frequency density**, not frequency directly.

---

### ðŸ§® **Key Formula**

$$
\text{Frequency Density} = \frac{\text{Frequency}}{\text{Class Width}}
$$

> This is used when class widths are **not equal**.

---

### âœ… **Key Points to Remember**

* **Area of bar = Frequency**
* Use histograms when data is **numerical and continuous**
* Class intervals can be of **unequal widths**
