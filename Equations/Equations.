## ðŸ“š **Detailed Revision Notes: Equations & Histograms**

### ðŸ§® **Equations**

#### ðŸ”¹ What is an Equation?

* An **equation** is a mathematical sentence that **shows equality** between two expressions.
* It contains an **equals sign (=)**.

**Example:**

$$
2x + 3 = 11
$$

#### ðŸ”¹ Goal: Solve for the Unknown

To **solve** an equation means to find the **value of the unknown variable** (usually x or y) that makes the equation true.

#### ðŸ”¹ Basic Solving Steps

1. **Simplify** both sides if needed.
2. Use **inverse operations** to isolate the variable.
3. **Keep the balance** â€“ do the same operation on both sides.
4. **Check** your solution by substituting it back into the equation.

#### ðŸ”¹ Types of Equations

| Type                        | Example                   | Method                                  |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| **One-step**                | $x + 5 = 12$              | Subtract 5 from both sides              |
| **Two-step**                | $3x - 4 = 11$             | Add 4, then divide by 3                 |
| **With brackets**           | $2(x + 3) = 14$           | Expand, then solve                      |
| **With fractions**          | $\frac{x}{3} + 2 = 6$     | Subtract 2, then multiply by 3          |
| **Variables on both sides** | $4x + 1 = 2x + 7$         | Rearrange terms, simplify, solve        |
| **Quadratic equations**     | $x^2 - 5x + 6 = 0$        | Factorise or use quadratic formula      |
| **Simultaneous equations**  | $x + y = 10$, $x - y = 2$ | Use substitution or elimination methods |

#### ðŸ”¹ Quadratic Formula (when needed)

$$
x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}
$$

For any equation in the form:

$$
ax^2 + bx + c = 0
$$

### ðŸ“Š **Histograms**

#### ðŸ”¹ What is a Histogram?

* A **histogram** is a graphical way to show **continuous data**.
* It looks like a bar chart, but:

  * **Bars touch** (because data is continuous).
  * The **area** of each bar represents **frequency**, not just the height.

---

#### ðŸ”¹ Key Terms

| Term                  | Meaning                                             |
| --------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| **Class interval**    | The groupings of continuous data (e.g. 0â€“10, 10â€“20) |
| **Frequency**         | How many values fall into each interval             |
| **Class width**       | The range of the interval (upper â€“ lower bound)     |
| **Frequency density** | Frequency divided by class width                    |

---

#### ðŸ”¹ Formula

$$
\text{Frequency Density} = \frac{\text{Frequency}}{\text{Class Width}}
$$

This is used **especially when class widths are not equal**.

---

#### ðŸ”¹ Steps to Draw a Histogram

1. Calculate the **frequency density** for each class.
2. Draw bars:

   * **Width** = class width
   * **Height** = frequency density
3. Label axes clearly:

   * **x-axis**: class intervals
   * **y-axis**: frequency density
4. No gaps between bars!

---

#### ðŸ”¹ Example

| Class Interval | Frequency |
| -------------- | --------- |
| 0 â€“ 5          | 10        |
| 5 â€“ 10         | 15        |
| 10 â€“ 20        | 30        |

Class widths = 5, 5, 10
Frequency densities:

* $\frac{10}{5} = 2$
* $\frac{15}{5} = 3$
* $\frac{30}{10} = 3$

---

### âœ… Final Tips

* Use **equations** to find unknown values.
* Use **histograms** to represent grouped continuous data visually.
* Always **label axes** and **show working** in exams.
* **Check answers** by substituting or verifying with calculations.
