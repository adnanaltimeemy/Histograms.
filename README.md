 What is a Histogram?
Histogram – Revision Note
A histogram is a type of bar graph used to represent continuous grouped data.
It shows frequency through the area of bars, not height alone.
Bars are joined together (no gaps) because the data is continuous.
The x-axis represents class intervals (e.g., 0–10, 10–20).
The y-axis shows frequency density, not frequency directly.
